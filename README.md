# NucleicAcidFold

This is an experimental implementation of nucleic acid secondary
structure prediction and analysis algorithms in Julia.  Nothing here
is guaranteed to work, but please open an issue if you are interested
in working on anything.

If you are looking for a more mature library in Julia i recommend you
look at [ViennaRNA.jl](https://github.com/marcom/ViennaRNA.jl).
